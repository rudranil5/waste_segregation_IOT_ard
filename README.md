# waste_segregation_IOT
This is the IoT component of our Smart Waste Segregation project.

This Part is  developed by Me.

We used an Arduino microcontroller to interface with and control all hardware components, including sensors, servos, and input modules.   
You can find the full project here:  <b><a href="https://github.com/rudranil5/Smart-waste-Segregation">  Rudranil's Github  </a></b>

## The hardware components we have used hare are
1.Three servo motors   
2.4 IR sensors  
3.moisture sensor  
4.Gas sensor  
5.Ultrasonic sensor .  

## Our main objective was 
### To seggregate the objects into two parts Recyclabe and Non recyclabe automatically .  
***First*** the sensors will check weather the bin is full or not . If not then the input lid will open .  
***Second*** the object is going to be detected by camera module then according to the respond it will go throung different sensors.  
***And** finally according to the result the lid of recyclable or non recyclabe lid is going to open
