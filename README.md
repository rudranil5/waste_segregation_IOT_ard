# waste_segregation_IOT
This is the IoT component of our Smart Waste Segregation project.
We used an Arduino microcontroller to interface with and control all hardware components, including sensors, servos, and input modules. 
You can find the full project here: https://github.com/rudranil5/Smart-waste-Segregation

#The hardware components we have used hare are 
1.Three servo motors 
2.4 IR sensors
3.moisture sensor
4.Gas sensor
5.Ultrasonic sensor .

#Our main objective was 
To seggregate the objects into two parts Recyclabe and Non recyclabe automatically .
** First the sensors will check weather the bin is full or not . If not then the input lid will open .
** Second the object is going to be detected by camera module then according to the respond it will go throung different sensors.
** And finally according to the result the lid of recyclable or non recyclabe lid is going to open
